# BackpacksFabric

BackpacksFabric - a StationAPI mod that adds bunch of backpacks to your game. Client/Server side.

## Setup
For setup instructions, please refer to [stationapi-example-mod page](https://github.com/calmilamsy/stationapi-example-mod).

There is no Fabric-API for beta 1.7.3, so this mod uses [StationAPI](https://github.com/ModificationStation/StationAPI).

## License
The project is under [MIT Licence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChessChicken-KZ/BackpacksFabric/local/LICENSE). Feel free to look at it.
